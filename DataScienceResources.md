## Data Pipeline & Tools

###Stats/Engineering Libraries
A collection of workhorse libraries that are elemental for any python data scientist.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Wes McKinney's pandas library for EDA on small to medium sized data sets when you don't want to put the infrastructure for SQL or when it isn't necessary.  It has many other great applications other than just better than SQL on small to medium data sets.
 
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) - Open-source software for mathematics, science and engineering.
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.


### Data Acquisition
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - A python library to make web-scraping HTML easier.
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) - HTTP for Humans - python library that makes working with http and api's more effortless

### Processing & Exploratory Data Analysis
* [Unix for Processing](http://www.theunixschool.com/p/awk-sed.html) - sed & awk for data processing.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - Already mentioned is great for data processing - cleaning, filtering and getting rid of nan's, normalizing, scaling, replacing values, etc.
* [SciKit Learn for Preprocessing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing) - Doc on sklearn's preprocessing methods.

### Databases/Frameworks
A collection of databases & frameworks that are helpful for data management and are the industry standard.
* [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) - Uses Hive Query Language (HQL) - similar to SQL for data at scale.
  * [Hive Cheatsheet](http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/08/Hortonworks.CheatSheet.SQLtoHive.pdf) - Self Explanatory.
* [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - For scalable, fast text search/analysis.
* [Redshift](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) - AWS petabyte-scale data warehouse solution.
* [Hadoop - the definitive guide](http://ce.sysu.edu.cn/hope/UploadFiles/Education/2011/10/201110221516245419.pdf) - Hadoop ecosystem.
* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) - Lightening fast cluster computing.


### Data Visualization
* [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) - ggplot for python ported by the team at yhat.
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - Awesome plotting library for python.
* [d3](http://d3js.org/) - Mike Bostock's viz library - the de facto gold standard for polished visualization - in js, steep learning curve but beautiful outcomes.
* [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) - Interactive visualization library.
* [d3py](https://github.com/mikedewar/d3py) - Another library for data viz.
* [vincent](http://vincent.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)  - Help with python for d3.
* [seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) - Clean statistical data visualization library.

### Data Science Conferences
* [Strata](http://strataconf.com/) - Conference and a lot of videos from previous conferences - great resource.
* [GraphLab](http://graphlab.com/events/conference14.html) 
* [PyData](http://pydata.org)


## Team Communication & Business Tools
* [Slack](https://slack.com) - Amazing team communication tool - abstracting away unnecessary e-mails.
* [Trello](https://trello.com) - Helping organize everything - great for project management.
* [Github](https://github.com) - Clearly a great product - 'Build software better, together'.
